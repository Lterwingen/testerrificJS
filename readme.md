##Introduction

Suggestions for future updates are always welcome. This includes features as well as code (style) improvement.

##Usage

As you can see in the example files. You need include

	-jQuery (I'm using 2.1.4, 1.7.0 minimum)
	-The CSS file : testerrific_basic.css (This is still a work in progress).

That's it. 

###Including files:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../testerrificJS/testerrific_basic.css" />


<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../testerrificJS/testerrific.js"></script>
